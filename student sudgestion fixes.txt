Brooklyn's suggestions:
Change the font color of the navigation menu drop down from blue to something like black so that it is slightly easier to read on the green background.
changed the dropdown menu black as requested

Change the placeholder button to just be the Olympic College Website Link.
changed the button to actualy say its for a link to OHS website

Ryan's suggestions:
On your styles.css I noticed that the bottom What Do We Do section on the bottom and how to join were not put in your declaration, so they are not receiving the same formatting.     #title p, #intro p, #roboinfo p, #location p {}.
got rid of the unesisary section

For the members page, the space between Students and Instructors feels a little large. I also preferred the design choice you made for the student's section adding space and indenting the names compared to the title.
fixed the space issue
